    <p>Every minute, there will be a race of <b>10</b> swimmers chosen from all the participants.</p>
    <p>The faster the swimmer, the higher the chance of them participating in races.</p>
    <p>You are to deduce the rankings of the swimmers in each race by making use of results from previous attempts in
        the hour.</p>
    <p>Score will be awarded for every position guessed correctly.</p>
